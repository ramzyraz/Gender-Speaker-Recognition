## Project Details

The project involved using the Techniques of Machine Learning to create a Multinomial Logistic Classifier for Gender Classification and Speaker Recognition using speech.      
-- Gender Recognition is the task of classifying gender (using binary gender classification:male/female) of speaker using their voice. 
-- Speaker Recognition problem was implemented in such a way as to classify the test utterance (recordingw) into one of the ùëÅ speaker classes.

The following describes the different processes which were used in Phase 2:

  1. Feature Extraction

  2. Implementation of the Multinomial Logistic Regression using a Softmax function for both Gender and Speech Recognition

  3. Calculating the Accuracy Scores And Plotting the Results
  
The following describes the different processes which were used in Phase 3:

  1. Feature Extraction

  2. Using Multiple Scikit-Learn Classifiers for Training and Testing the Dataset
  
  a. Multi-layer Perceptron   
  b. Linear Support Vector Classification 
  c. Gaussian Naive Bayes 
    
  3. Calculating the Accuracy Scores And Plotting the Results for each Classifier
